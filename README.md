# CompareDrivers
Script to compare drivers over time on a computer. 

This is my attempt at automating driver documentation.
The idea is to stick the script on a file share and then run it after testing a set of drivers for one of your computer models. 
The script will then show you the changes since the first time you ran the script and since last time you ran it.
